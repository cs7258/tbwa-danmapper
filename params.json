{"body":"[TBWA\\DAN Mapper](http://labs.tbwa.com.hk/danmapper/)\r\n=================\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://logotype.se/dnmp.png\">\r\n\r\nProjection Mapping is a exciting projection technique that can turn almost any surface or object into a dynamic video display. DANMapper can mask and distort the projected image and make it fit perfectly on different perspectives. When done right, the end result is a dynamic projection installation that transcends ordinary video projection. \r\n\r\nAll you need is a projector to get started. Launch DANMapper, browse for a video or SWF. For realtime data, you can import any SWF which loads external data, displays charts, physics engines, news feeds, games and more. DANMapper is built with a minimal interface and easy-to-use functions. You'll see a live preview on your screen, and context menus for fast editing. To hide the UI and make the projection live, simply double click. \r\n\r\nCreated and maintained by [Victor Norgren](http://logotype.se)\r\n\r\nQuick start\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nClone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/logotype/tbwa-danmapper.git`.\r\n\r\nDownload [Build for Mac](http://labs.tbwa.com.hk/danmapper/DANMapper_0932.zip)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n+ Unlimited amount of mapped elements\r\n+ Shapes: rectangles and polygons\r\n+ Direct SWF import (realtime data)\r\n+ Save and Load configurations\r\n+ Duplicate quad, quick editing\r\n+ Master/slave synchronization for multiple quads\r\n+ H264 HD video support\r\n+ Compatible with Mac, Windows and Linux\r\n\r\nUpcoming features\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n+ Multi-screen/projector synching over local network\r\n+ Bezier curved shapes\r\n+ Better editing mode with image reference function\r\n+ Change of video library to recent videos\r\n+ Tablet remote control feature\r\n+ And general bug fixing\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n-------\r\n\r\n**Victor Norgren**\r\n\r\n+ http://twitter.com/logotype\r\n+ http://github.com/logotype\r\n+ http://logotype.se\r\n\r\n**Mimosa Poon**\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright and license\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2012 TBWA\\ Digital Arts Network\r\n\r\nAuthors: Victor Norgren, Mimosa Poon\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to\r\ndeal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the\r\nrights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or\r\nsell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright\r\nnotice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or\r\nsubstantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
